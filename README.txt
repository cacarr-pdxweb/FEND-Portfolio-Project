Udacity Front-End Nanodegree - Project 1 - Portfolio Site

Rather than replicating the provided PDF site mockup using a framework like Boostrap -- which would not have been very challenging -- I elected to adhere to the rubric in building a functional, one-page portfolio site from scratch, utilizing CSS Grid for site layout, along with Flexbox for aligning some elements within grid areas. This approach gave me a useful, very basic introduction to Grid and Flexbox, and provided general CSS practice by building UI components without resorting to a framework. 


Some features:

-- Menu items link to page sections.

-- 5 breakpoints.

-- Utilizes CSS Custom Properties/Variables. Perhaps needlessly, but I wanted to acquaint myself with the feature.

-- Showcases a few WordPress websites I've built previously, along with Udacity projects.


Improvements would include a more intersting, complex layout utilizing additional CSS Grid techniques. It could also use some JavaScript/jQuery enhancements -- e.g., smooth scrolling to anchor links, and a hover color change on the vector graphics icons. And, the CSS needs to be reorganized into a less spaghetti-likes state. It's a bit of a redundant mess.
